# Portals

I built this site to test out [portals](https://web.dev/hands-on-portals).

In order for it to work appropriately, you'll need to run it in [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) with the Portals flag on.

[Read my blog about it](https://ogdenstudios.xyz/2019/05/31/lessons-learned-thinking-with-chrome-portals.html).
